# Alzheimer Disease Prediction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurological disorder that affects the brain, leading to memory loss, cognitive impairment, and changes in behavior and personality. It is the most common cause of dementia among older adults and is characterized by the buildup of abnormal protein deposits in the brain, including amyloid plaques and tau tangles.
The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not yet fully understood, but it is believed to be influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Age is also a significant risk factor, with the risk of developing the disease increasing significantly after the age of 65.The early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease may include mild memory loss, difficulty with problem-solving, and changes in mood or behavior. As the disease progresses, these symptoms become more severe, with individuals experiencing significant memory loss, difficulty communicating, and a loss of the ability to perform daily activities.
By using deep learning models like Xception to analyze medical imaging data, it may be able to identify early signs of Alzheimer's disease before symptoms become severe. This can help healthcare providers to provide early treatment and support for patients and their families, ultimately leading to better outcomes for all involved.
